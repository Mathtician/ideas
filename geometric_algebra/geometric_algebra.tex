\section{Introduction}
Geometric algebras (or real Clifford algebras) provide a unified framework
for diverse topics in math and physics,
mostly centered on transformations in $n$-dimensional space.
These include but are not limited to
the familiar reflections, rotations, and translations of Euclidean space;
the hyperbolic rotations, AKA Lorentz boosts, which appear in special relativity;
the circle inversions used in compass-and-straightedge constructions
and their higher-dimensional analogs;
and the perspective transformations which find applications in computer vision.
They can represent area, volume, and beyond
in the same way that vectors represent length.
When Clifford algebras are constructed using complex numbers instead of reals,
they capture the unitary transformations and spinors of quantum mechanics.
When combined with calculus, geometric algebra encompasses the theory of differential forms.

\subsection{Linear algebra review}

Since geometric algebra is an extension of linear algebra,
a review of the basic ideas of the latter
will be helpful in understanding the former.
For this section, scalars are in italics and vectors are in bold.
However, geometric algebra adds many other objects to scalars and vectors
(and in fact, scalars are themselves represented as vectors),
so the distinction between them becomes less meaningful.
For this reason, all variables will be italicized in later sections.

A vector space consists of a set of scalars $F$ and a set of vectors $V$.
$F$ must be a field, meaning that
scalars may be added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided
(except by zero) to produce another scalar.
The functions of addition and multiplication,
as well as the additive and multiplicative inverses
which make subtraction and division possible,
must obey certain properties for $F$ to be a field,
e.g. $a+b=b+a$ for all scalars $a$ and $b$.
These notes will focus mostly on the cases
where $F=\mathbb{R}$, the field of real numbers.
For $V$ to form a vector space,
vectors must be able to be added to one another
or multiplied by a scalar to produce another vector.
These functions of vector addition and scalar multiplication, too,
must obey certain properties,
e.g. $a(\vb{u}+\vb{v}) = a\vb{u}+a\vb{v}$
for all scalars $a$ and vectors $\vb{u}$ and $\vb{v}$.
(This property can be stated as
``the scalar product respects vector addition''.)

Every vector space has a basis, a set of vectors
which may be multiplied by scalars and added to each other
to uniquely produce any vector in $V$.
The size of the basis is called the dimension of $V$.
These notes are concerned with vector spaces with finite dimension $n$,
so for a given basis $\{\vb{e}_1, \ldots, \vb{e}_n\}$,
every vector $\vb{v} \in V$ can be uniquely represented as  $v_1\vb{e}_1+\hdots+v_n\vb{e}_n$,
where $v_1, \ldots, v_n \in F$.
The vector space is thus called $F^n$,
or specifically $\mathbb{R}^n$ in the case of geometric algebras.
For short, $\vb{v}$ is often written as a column listing these scalars:
\[\vb{v} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ \vdots \\ v_n \end{bmatrix}\]

Vectors are basic objects in linear algebra, along with matrices,
which represent ways to transform vectors
in a way that respects vector addition and scalar multiplication.


\section{Definition}

\subsection{Algebras}

Despite everything than can be shown about vector spaces alone,
they do not define a way to multiply two vectors.
This lack gives rise to the idea of an algebra:
a vector space equipped with an additional operation
which multiplies two vectors to produce another vector.
This vector product is constrained by only one rule:
it must be linear with respect to both arguments,
i.e. when one argument is fixed,
it must respect vector addition and scalar multiplication in the other argument.
In general, the vector product does not need to be commutative, associative, etc.
However, thanks to the constraint of linearity,
it is only necessary to define the products of the basis vectors with each other,
and all other values of the product become defined.
For example, consider a two-dimensional vector space
with a basis $\{e_1, e_2\}$
and two vectors within that space
$u = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$
and $v = \begin{bmatrix} c \\ d \end{bmatrix}$.
\footnote{As mentioned in the review of linear algebra,
  vectors will be italicized like other variables from this point forward.}
If $e_1e_1$, $e_1e_2$, $e_2e_1$, and $e_2e_2$ are known,
then
\[
uv
= \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} c \\ d \end{bmatrix}
= (ae_1+be_2)(ce_1+de_2)
= ace_1e_1+ade_1e_2+bce_2e_1+bde_2e_2.
\]
Scalars must commute with the vector product,
hence $ace_1e_1$ is written above instead of $ae_1ce_1$.
However, $e_1e_2$ and $e_2e_1$ are distinguished
and not combined as like terms,
since the vector product itself is not necessarily commutative.

\subsubsection{The cross product}

For example, the cross product $\times$ forms an algebra over $\mathbb{R}^3$,
and it returns the following for all pairs of basis vectors,
where $0$ is the null vector:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|}
    \hline
    $\times$ & $e_1$ & $e_2$ & $e_3$ \\ \hhline{|=#=|=|=|}
    $e_1$ & $0$ & $e_3$ & $-e_2$ \\ \hline
    $e_2$ & $-e_3$ & $0$ & $e_1$ \\ \hline
    $e_3$ & $e_2$ & $-e_1$ & $0$ \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

As shown in the table,
the cross product is anticommutative rather than commutative,
i.e. $u \times v = -v \times u$ for all basis vectors
and, by extension, for all vectors $u$ and $v$.
This vector product is widely used in physics
to calculate quantities related to rotation, such as angular momentum.
However, it cannot be generalized to higher dimensions,
but it can be restricted to work in two
by omitting the last row and column of the table.
Notice, though, that the result will simply be a scalar multiple of $e_3$,
so the cross product in 2D effectively returns a scalar instead of a vector.
The cross product, then, has the peculiar property
that it returns a scalar in two dimensions,
a vector in three dimensions,
and nothing in any other dimension.
Additionally, since the components of vectors usually contain a unit of length,
e.g. meters or meters/second,
the cross product of two such vectors has units of area.

Geometric algebra defines an alternative to the cross product
which works in any number of dimensions,
which always returns the same type of object,
and which has a more natural geometric interpretation.
This will be discussed in later sections.

Classical (Newtonian) mechanics relies on three principles
governing the symmetries of space and time.
For this section, ``frames of reference'' refer specifically to inertial frames of reference,
namely those of observers which are not accelerating.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Shifts between frames of reference are performed by linear transformations.
\item The laws of physics remain the same for all frames of reference.
\item The passage of time is absolute for all frames of reference.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Conformal transformations}

\section{From \texorpdfstring{$\mathbb{R}$}{R}
  to \texorpdfstring{$\mathbb{C}$}{C}
  to \texorpdfstring{$\mathbb{H}$}{H}}

So far, the components of multivectors have been real numbers,
and the Clifford algebra has been generated by a quadratic form.
With a few tricks related to representations, we can extend what we know
about Clifford algebras over the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$
to related algebras over the complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$
and algebra-like objects over the quaternions $\mathbb{H}$.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$\mathbb{R}$}{R} to \texorpdfstring{$\mathbb{C}$}{C}}

A complex number $a+bi$ can be represented by the $2 \times 2$ real matrix
$\begin{bmatrix} a & -b \\ b & a \end{bmatrix}$
so that complex addition, multiplication, and inverses
map to the corresponding operations on matrices.
For example,
\begin{align*}
  (a+bi) (c+di) &= (ac-bd)+(bc+ad)i, \\
  \text{and} \begin{bmatrix} a & -b \\ b & a \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} c & -d \\ d & c \end{bmatrix} &=
  \begin{bmatrix} ac-bd & -(bc+ad) \\ bc+ad & ac-bd \end{bmatrix}.
\end{align*}
This matrix can also be thought of as a linear transformation of the plane,
namely a scaling and rotation.

Likewise, an $m \times n$ complex matrix can be represented as a $2m \times 2n$ real matrix,
with each $2 \times 2$ block of the real matrix representing a single entry of the complex matrix.
Since breaking down matrices into blocks, multiplying them as units,
then adding the results together is a valid method of matrix multiplication,
the complex matrix product is preserved with this real representation.

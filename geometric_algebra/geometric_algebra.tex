\section{Introduction}
Geometric algebras (or real Clifford algebras) provide a unified framework
for diverse topics in math and physics,
mostly centered on transformations in $n$-dimensional space.
These include but are not limited to
the familiar reflections, rotations, and translations of Euclidean space;
the hyperbolic rotations, AKA Lorentz boosts, which appear in special relativity;
the circle inversions used in compass-and-straightedge constructions
and their higher-dimensional analogs;
and the perspective transformations which find applications in computer vision.
They can represent area, volume, and beyond
in the same way that vectors represent length.
When Clifford algebras are constructed using complex numbers instead of reals,
they capture the unitary transformations and spinors of quantum mechanics.
When combined with calculus, geometric algebra encompasses the theory of differential forms.

\subsection{Linear algebra review}

Since geometric algebra is an extension of linear algebra,
a review of the basic ideas of the latter
will be helpful in understanding the former.
For this section, scalars are in italics and vectors are in bold.
However, geometric algebra adds many other objects to scalars and vectors
(and in fact, scalars are themselves represented as vectors),
so the distinction between them becomes less meaningful.
For this reason, all variables will be italicized in later sections.

A vector space consists of a set of scalars $F$ and a set of vectors $V$.
$F$ must be a field, meaning that
scalars may be added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided
(except by zero) to produce another scalar.
The functions of addition and multiplication,
as well as the additive and multiplicative inverses
which make subtraction and division possible,
must obey certain properties for $F$ to be a field,
e.g. $a+b=b+a$ for all scalars $a$ and $b$.
These notes will focus mostly on the cases
where $F=\mathbb{R}$, the field of real numbers.
For $V$ to form a vector space,
vectors must be able to be added to one another
or multiplied by a scalar to produce another vector.
These functions of vector addition and scalar multiplication, too,
must obey certain properties,
e.g. $a(\vb{u}+\vb{v}) = a\vb{u}+a\vb{v}$
for all scalars $a$ and vectors $\vb{u}$ and $\vb{v}$.

Every vector space has a basis, a set of vectors
which may be multiplied by scalars and added to each other
to uniquely produce any vector in $V$.
The size of the basis is called the dimension of $V$.
These notes are concerned with vector spaces with finite dimension $n$,
so for a given basis $\vb{e_1}, \ldots, \vb{e_n}$,
every vector $\vb{v}$ can be uniquely represented as  $v_1\vb{e_1}+\hdots+v_n\vb{e_n}$,
where $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ are scalars.
For short, $\vb{v}$ is often written with a column listing these scalars:
\[\vb{v} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ \vdots \\ v_n \end{bmatrix}\]

Vectors are basic objects in linear algebra, along with matrices,
which represent ways to transform vectors.

\section{Definition}

Despite everything than can be shown about vector spaces alone,
they do not define a way to multiply two vectors.
This lack gives rise to the idea of an algebra:
a vector space equipped with an additional operation
which multiplies two vectors to produce another vector.
This vector product is constrained by only one rule:
it must be linear with respect to both arguments,
i.e. when one argument is fixed,
it must respect vector addition and scalar multiplication in the other argument.
In general, it does not need to be commutative, associative, etc.
However, thanks to the constraint of linearity,
it is only necessary to define the products of all the basis vectors with each other,
and

\subsubsection{Classical mechanics}
Classical (Newtonian) mechanics relies on three principles
governing the symmetries of space and time.
For this section, ``frames of reference'' refer specifically to inertial frames of reference,
namely those of observers which are not accelerating.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Shifts between frames of reference are performed by linear transformations.
\item The laws of physics remain the same for all frames of reference.
\item The passage of time is absolute for all frames of reference.
\end{enumerate}

\section{From \texorpdfstring{$\mathbb{R}$}{R}
  to \texorpdfstring{$\mathbb{C}$}{C}
  to \texorpdfstring{$\mathbb{H}$}{H}}

So far, the components of multivectors have been real numbers,
and the Clifford algebra has been generated by a quadratic form.
With a few tricks related to representations, we can extend what we know
about Clifford algebras over the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$
to related algebras over the complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$
and algebra-like objects over the quaternions $\mathbb{H}$.

A complex number $a+bi$ can be represented by the $2 \times 2$ real matrix
$\begin{bmatrix} a & -b \\ b & a \end{bmatrix}$
so that complex addition, multiplication, and inverses
map to the corresponding operations on matrices.
For example,
\begin{align*}
  (a+bi) (c+di) &= (ac-bd)+(bc+ad)i, \\
  \text{and} \begin{bmatrix} a & -b \\ b & a \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} c & -d \\ d & c \end{bmatrix} &=
  \begin{bmatrix} ac-bd & -(bc+ad) \\ bc+ad & ac-bd \end{bmatrix}.
\end{align*}
This matrix can also be thought of as a linear transformation of the plane,
namely a scaling and rotation.

Likewise, an $m \times n$ complex matrix can be represented as a $2m \times 2n$ real matrix,
with each $2 \times 2$ block of the real matrix representing a single entry of the complex matrix.
Since breaking down matrices into blocks, multiplying them as units,
then adding the results together is a valid method of matrix multiplication,
the complex matrix product is preserved with this real representation.

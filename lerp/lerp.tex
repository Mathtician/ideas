\title{Monotone Cubic Interpolation}
\author{Aresh Pourkavoos}
\maketitle

Given a set of data points $(x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$
in which both coordinates strictly increase moving down the list
(i.e. $x_1 < \ldots < x_n$ and $y_1 < \ldots < y_n$),
how can we define a function $f(x) = y$ which passes through all points
and which has positive slope everywhere?
Drawing line segments between adjacent points almost works,
but the derivative may be undefined at each point,
since the slopes of the segments on either side may be different.

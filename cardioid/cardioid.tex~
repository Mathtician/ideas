\title{The Cartesian Cardioid}
\author{Aresh Pourkavoos}
\maketitle

This article is a bit less math-heavy than usual.
Here, I want to illustrate a general principle of problem-solving:
\textbf{The form of a solution often suggests a method to derive it.}

The cardioid (literally ``heart-shaped thing'') is a 2D shape
defined by the polar equation $r=1-\cos\theta$.

It appears in a myriad of places (see \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardioid}{Wikipedia}),
including in the Mandelbrot Set fractal and in the sensitivity patterns of some microphones.
I wanted to know its representation in Cartesian coordinates, with $y$ as a function of $x$.
(I don't remember my inital motivation for this project;
likely I just thought it would be a fun exercise.)
After a fairly long process, I arrived at the answer,
\[y = \pm\sqrt{\frac{1\pm\sqrt{1-4x}}{2}-x-x^2},\]
where the two $\pm$ signs can vary independently.
Compared to the complexity of some of the intermediate stages,
the brevity of the answer surprised me. In math, though,
\textbf{there are very few real coincidences.
  If a large number of terms just seem to cancel out,
  there is likely an easier way through.}
So, I applied the principle mentioned at the beginning of this article.
I wanted to find a shorter derivation of this formula,
and find a shorter derivation I did.

\textit{Note: what follows is less rigorousness and more of a thought process and intuition.
  Both have their place in math, and although we rely on the former to verify theorems,
  the latter is often responsible for coming up with them in the first place.
}

First of all, the first term inside the large square root (call it $z$) looks like the quadratic formula,
suggesting that it could be the root(s) of a quadratic equation.
The individual terms within $z$ can be mapped to those in the formula, giving
$-b=1$, $b^2-4ac=1-4x$, $2a=2$.
Solving for the coefficients yields $a=1$, $b=-1$, and $c=x$.
Thus, in the ideal derivation, there might be an equation
\[z^2-z+x=0\]
which we have to solve with the quadratic formula.

How would we arrive at $z$ during the ideal derivation, though?
If we could isolate $z$ within the answer and write it in terms of $x$ and $y$,
we might have another equation that appears there.
Doing this just requires squaring and adding $x^2+x$ to both sides,
yielding
\[y^2+x^2+x=z.\]

At first, the last equation doesn't look like much.
Looking back at the original polar formula
suggests no obvious way to get there (or to $z^2-z+x=0$, for that matter).
That is, until we recognize the $x^2+y^2$ term
as part of the identities that connect Cartesian to polar coordinates,
specifically $x^2+y^2=r^2$.
Substituting this into the second equation yields
\[r^2+x=z,\]
which starts to bear a resemblance to $z^2-z+x=0$.
The final epiphany comes when we see that the equations can be rearranged to look almost identical:
\[r^2=z-x, z^2=z-x,\]
revealing the true identity of $z$ as $r$ all along!
(We are ignoring a potential $\pm$, but this is the intuitive process of finding a derivation,
not the rigorous process of finding an answer.)
By substitution, we can write a single equation from which everything thus far can be derived:
\[r^2-r+x=0.\]

The final step in this process (and thus the first step in the ideal derivation)
is to obtain this formula from the original $r=1-\cos\theta$.
Somehow, we need to eliminate $\cos\theta$ and introduce $x$.
For that, we refer to the identity $\cos\theta=x/r$
and recognize that multiplying both sides of the original formula by $r$
will achieve the desired effect.

After all of that backwards work, the derivation we find is as follows:

\begin{align*}
\text{The polar equation of the cardioid is: } & r = 1-\cos(\theta) \\
\text{Multiplying both sides by } r \text{: } & r^2 = r-x \\
\text{Rearranging to obtain a quadratic equation: } & r^2-r+x = 0 \\
\text{Solving for } r \text{ in terms of } x \text{ with the quadratic formula: } & r = \frac{1\pm\sqrt{1-4x}}{2} \\
\text{Substituting } x^2+y^2 \text{ for } r^2 \text{ in the second equation: } & x^2+y^2 = r-x \\
\text{Rearranging to solve for } y^2 \text{ in terms of } r \text{ and } x \text{: } & y^2 = r-x-x^2 \\
\text{Substituting for } r \text{ from the fourth equation: } & y^2 = \frac{1\pm\sqrt{1-4x}}{2}-x-x^2\\
\text{Solving for } y \text{ in terms of } x \text{: } & y = \pm\sqrt{\frac{1\pm\sqrt{1-4x}}{2}-x-x^2}
\end{align*}

What I love about this derivation is that I'm almost sure that \textbf{it can't be made any shorter.}
Every part of the answer has a clear origin in some step of the derivation, and nothing canceled out seemingly by chance.
The idea that there are virtually no ``accidents'' or coincidences in math
doesn't just apply to this particular problem (although I think this derivation exemplifies it).

For example, when Newton formulated the Second Law of Motion and the Law of Universal Gravitation,
it just happened to be that all objects in the same gravitational field accelerate at the same rate
because the term for the mass $m$ of the falling body cancels out.
This apparent coincidence was not explained until centuries later,
when Einstein discovered the theory of General Relativity.
GR defines the trajectory of falling objects as a ``straight'' line in a curved spacetime
independently of $m$ (assuming $m$ has a negligible gravitational effect).

As another example, a short derivation of the Gaussian integral
\[\int_{x=-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-x^2}dx=\sqrt{\pi}\]
 begins by squaring

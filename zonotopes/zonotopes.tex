\title{Rendering zonotope cross-sections}
\author{Aresh Pourkavoos}
\maketitle

This project is the culmination of a train of thought
that started around a year ago
with the question of whether I could build an icosahedron in Minecraft.
I had learned that the coordinates of one were based on the golden ratio
$\varphi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$

Approximation of phi

What is a zonotope?

Construction method

C program

The omnitruncated 120-cell

The golden ring

The omnitruncated 24-cell

The $\sqrt{2}$ ring
